hello there :3c<br><br>
<b>who am i??</b><br>
i am <ruby>zino<rt>joão henrique flauzino</rt></ruby>, a 20yo brazilian information systems student at <ruby>UNIFEI<rt>Universidade Federal de Itajubá</rt></ruby>, currently on my fifth semester.<br>
i would describe myself as someone inherently curious and investigative of the world around me, which gave me the push to start coding at all!<br>
	<br><br>
<b>what am i doing??</b><br>
while i do consider myself a generalist in the sense that i am probably adventuring myself in something new, i do have more tangible experience in gamedev and webdev.<br>
i have participated in the development of games such as <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Unstable_and_Unimaginable_Power">東方稀濳群 ～ Unstable and Unimaginable Power</a>, working a <ruby>developer<rt>menu, extra stage</rt></ruby><br><br>
i am currently participating in the development of a bunch of games, so stay tuned for future releases!<br>
